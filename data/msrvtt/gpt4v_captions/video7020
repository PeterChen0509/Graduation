"A person shapes pink fondant to form a tiny baby figure and then begins covering it with a green fondant leaf. The green leaf is carefully positioned and wrapped around the baby figure, resembling a blanket. The scene then transitions to hands rolling out yellow fondant with a rolling pin on a grid-patterned surface. The person uses a floral cutter to create a flower shape out of the yellow fondant, removing the cutter to reveal the flower. Finally, they use scissors to refine the edges of the fondant flower."
